# Generate a temporary file path according to template
TMP=$(mktemp -ut live-build.pipe.XXXX)

# Create a FIFO (named pipe) at that location
# and set an exit trap to clean it up
mkfifo ${TMP} && trap "rm ${TMP}" EXIT HUP INT TERM

# Start tee, reading from the temporary pipe and writing
# the build log, then send it in background
tee build.$(date +'%F.%H%Mh').log < ${TMP} &

# Now trigger actual build process, redirecting output
# to that named pipe, and leave with lb's exit status.
lb build noauto "${@}" > ${TMP} 2>&1
